					<h5>ABOUT US</h5>
					<p>SSC 2002 & HSC 2004 Bangladesh is today more than just any other social group on not only Facebook but any social networking website in the world. Officially this is the largest social networking group found on entire World Wide Web (WWW) which has been formed on 12th May 2019 with nationwide batch mates from Secondary School Certificate (SSC) of 2002 and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) of 2004 of Bangladesh. The primary idea was to know each other, make friends, planning for meetings & hangouts in social occasions. Today this group has grown beyond imagination with a vast worldwide network with the sincere dedication and efforts of the enthusiastic group members. A platform beyond religion, beyond casts and countries, full of cross cultural energetic youths ready to come up with any sort of help required by a friend. With the vision -Friend for a friend and together friends for the nation-, for social & environmental well being, this group started blood donation activities in 15th February 2018 under the banner of Blood Bank 0204, and in the first year of operation, we have collected more than 1700 bags of blood from 1000 members of this great group and donated to save many lives. However, the motto is... No life losses for blood. “Warm Love” (Winter Clothes distribution program) a social welfare program coordinated by this group is an example that significantly indicates the affection and enthusiasm of group members towards humanity. In the year of 2017, the group “SSC 2002 & HSC 2004 Bangladesh” distributed more than 3000 blankets and 2000 winter clothes to the poverty-stricken people in rural areas of Kurigram, Bangladesh. The program “Silent Smile” initiated in the year 2018 and 2019, has brought significant contribution to the socially deprived children, especially for those who cannot afford new dresses in religious festivals like EID & PUJA. We believe, if children are our future then a little smile can bring a brighter future for us to enlighten this society. Evermore, “Run for humanity’ (POST flood campaign) is another social welfare program initiated in 2017 by this group to help the people who are dramatically affected by natural disaster. Every year in Bangladesh, a large number of rural population is affected by over rain, flood & land slide losing their households ending up under the open sky without any food. Most of the time government aid takes too long to reach those disastrous area which is not enough compared to the number of people affected every year. ‘SSC 2002 & HSC 2004 Bangladesh’ distributed dry food and medicine to the people who lost their homes and even lives of close ones in natural devastation. It really is a matter of utmost pride for this group that we came so far only with the sincere contribution of our group members and no fund has yet been raised from outside this group. Being a part of this group really makes one feel proud and prestigious. We are working with same dedication to turn this group into a global platform of peace, friends and beyond all, well being of the humanity.We want to laugh , cry, play and above all, unite and stand together. In every hard time, the harsh world might whisper WHO CARES?? WE proudly SAY, YES WE DO, ALL THE TIME ALL THE WAY ... TOGETHER WITH SSC 2002 & HSC 2004 BANGLADESH FOUNDATION.</p>
